## My process

This challenge was a lot of fun as I felt confident I could do it. I started making the HTML as clean as I could and once I was happy with that I incorporated the CSS. I try to use Flexbox as much as I can so I can get use to it.
The hover state was a bit of a new thing for me but nothing that I couldn't do with a little bit of online resarch.
Althought maybe I could have done it without, because is quite a simple design, I used mediaquery to make sure my solution fits mobile as nicely as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mediaquery

### What I learned

I think my css skills are getting better, I've learnt more about what I can achieve using position absolute and relative, also flexbox always has something new for me to learn.

### Continued development

I'd like to make my coding more clean and also incorporate CSS Grid and SCSS in future challenges.
